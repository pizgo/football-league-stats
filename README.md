# Football stats

## What it does:
* displays data about Ekstraklasa (polish footall league) matches results in the following manner:
    *  after selecting specific season, user is provided with information about all matches played during this period: team names, date, final scores, half          scores and stadium name
    *  the winner/looser/draw are identified by colors
    *  when match's table row is clicked, user is being redirected to a new match info subpage with detailed information about the game: which players            scored goals and timeline with all the match events
    * 

## Why I made this 
* to practice working with external API, custom hooks and Typescript

## Technologies:
* Typescript
* React.js
* react-router-dom
* custom hooks
* React Bootstrap

## Future improvements:
* migrating state to Redux
* adding tests
* RWD
* adding filters to table columns
* display more data about te specific match
* working on UI and make it fund and modern
